# Object And Classes

## Feature of OOP
  - Encapsulation (hiding)
    - Hiding implementation details
    - exposing external behavior (public methods)
    - Class are the unit of encapsulation
    - 언어적 구현의 관점
  - Inheritance (Reusing)
    - Reusing existing classes
    - SuperClass - SubClass relationship
  - Data abstraction
    - 어떤 정보를 encapsulate 할 것인가? 
    - generalization
    - specification    
    - 성질의 관점

## Value chain of OOP
  - cost reduction by increasing productivity
  - increasing productivity by effective development and, maintenance
  - effective development and, maintenance by reusibility (easy to read and write)
  - increasing reusibility by encapsulation, Inheritance

## Class and Object
  - Class : template and blueprint
    - describes object data(field) and, behavior(method)
    - uses 'method' to send message between objects
  - Object : Instance made by the template(Class)
    - Identity + instance variables

## Identifing Class and Methods
  - Responsibility assignment
    - identify responsibility -> identify methods and classes -> identify data(attributes)  

## Relationship between Classes
  - "use-a" : association : 사용관계 : 상호작용
  - "has-a" : aggregation and composition : 집합관계 : 부품
  - "is-a" : inheritance : 상속관계 : 구체화된 하위객체
